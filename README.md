## Important Notice

This app is **NOT OFFICIAL** by [Burning Series](https://bs.to/)!!!

This is a personal project and doesn't rely on any official API by [Burning Series](https://bs.to/), that means it could break any time.
It's not guaranteed that this project will be maintained, especially not by any owner or developer of [Burning Series](https://bs.to/).
If the app stops working don't report that in any form on [Burning Series](https://bs.to/), instead open an [Issue](https://github.com/DATL4G/BurningSeries-Android/issues/new/choose) or fix it yourself and create a pull request here.

**This project is not related to any owner, developer or other staff from [Burning Series](https://bs.to/)**

**Furthermore, this project is for personal and educational purposes only**

## Supported devices and Installation

All Android smartphones with version >=6.0 (Marshmallow and up) as well as Android TVs are supported.

To install the app head over to the [Release Section](https://github.com/DATL4G/Burning-Series/releases) and download the ```.apk``` file. For more advanced users is an ```.aab``` file provided which can be installed using [bundletool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/bundletool).
Installing the ```.apk``` file is easy, just copy it to your phone (or download it directly on your phone) and open it to install. If this won't work you can use [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) sideloading to install it from your pc on your phone.

You can also download the app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.datlag.burningseries/).

Search on the internet if you face any problems. Don't ask for help here!

### Desktop

- **Windows** (tested by member)
- **MacOS** (untested)
- **Linux**
  - Fedora
  - AppImage
  - Debian / Ubuntu
  - Tarball

### Browser (Activation Extension)

If you can't access [bs.to](https://bs.to) you have to enable DoH (DNS over HTTPS).
Setting this up may differ depending on your browser, however I suggest to use **Cloudflare** as provider.

The extension doesn't need to be updated every version, it just follows the overall versioning scheme.
If an update is required/recommended, then there is a hint in the [release notes](https://github.com/DATL4G/Burning-Series/releases/latest).

- **Chromium**
  - Chrome
  - Brave
  - Opera
  - Edge
  - etc...
- **Firefox**
  - may require to allow some website permissions manually
